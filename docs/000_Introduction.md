# What is *phpgeo?*

_phpgeo_ is a small PHP library which provides abstractions to geographical
coordinates (including support for different ellipsoids), polylines
("GPS Tracks"), polygons, bounds, and more. _phpgeo_ allows you to perform
different calculations with these abstractions, as distances, track
lengths, etc.
